ML Spam Detection (SSOSM) · author: thenootz

---

## 📌 Overview
**NOOTZSCOPE** is a Machine Learning–based email spam classifier developed for the **SSOSM laboratory**.  
It classifies emails as **clean (`cln`)** or **infected/spam (`inf`)** using generic ML techniques (TF-IDF + linear models), fully compliant with course rules.

No prebuilt anti-spam libraries are used.

---

## 🧠 Approach
- **Text representation**
  - Word n-grams (1–2)
  - Character n-grams (3–5)
- **Model**
  - Linear classifier (Logistic Regression / Linear SVM)
- **Input**
  - Email subject = first line of file
  - Email body = rest of file
  - Supports text or HTML, unknown encodings
- **Output**
  - Deterministic, strict format required by the assignment

## 🖥️ CLI Usage

### Project info
```bash
python main.py -info output.json
```

## 🐍 Virtual Environment Setup (Python 3.12)

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to ensure reproducible results.

### Create venv
```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

deactivate
```
